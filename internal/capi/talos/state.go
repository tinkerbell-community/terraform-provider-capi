// Package talos implements a capi.Bootstrapper that provisions a single-node
// Talos Linux cluster on a bare-metal machine through its BMC.
//
// The bootstrapper is an observed-state reconciler: each iteration probes the
// BMC and the Talos API, a pure planner chooses exactly one action from the
// observation, and the action layer executes small idempotent steps. Nothing
// about the node is persisted; a restart converges again from observation.
